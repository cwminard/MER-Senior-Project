I'll be reading out our midterm progress report for this video as of October 16, 2025. We Team 5 have made progress towards our project which is focused on multimodal emotion recognition. Items highlighted in green are completed, items highlighted in yellow are work in progress and items highlighted in red have not been started. As for the front end progress, the front end is currently a work in progress majority complete with accessibility refinements needed. Currently in progress are the welcome page, the file uploader capture area, the profile, while the sign in sign up pages, the preferences page, the menu page are all complete. The figma prototype has been completed as well as the database initialized for user login credentials. As for the back end, we have the camera capture established with the audio capture established as well which I'm demonstrating now. We also have space to text transcription enabled which is also being demonstrated. Now in progress is sentiment analysis which we will be using NLTK for. We also doing emotion recognition with the face which is also in progress as well as additional functions that we have not yet defined. As for the mobile app progress, we have the front end complete, the user can visualize themselves and we also have the AI machine learning in progress. Thank you.
